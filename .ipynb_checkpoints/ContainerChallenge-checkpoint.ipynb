    "# Welcome to the DISCOVER Hack Shack Container Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenge prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend you attend or watch the following recorded Discover Hack Shack Workshops before attempting this challenge:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Hack Shack Workshop: Git 101](../../WKSHP-GIT101/0-ReadmeFirst.ipynb)\n",
    "2. [Hack Shack Workshop: Streamline app development with open source Grommet](../../WKSHP-Grommet/0-ReadmeFirst.ipynb)\n",
    "3. [Hack Shack W479: Introduction to the HPE Container Platform REST API](../../WKSHP-HPECP-API/0-ReadmeFirst.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, make sure you leverage the notebooks provided in your Jupyter account environment as reference material.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Please note, your account session will only be allocated for a 4-hour time slot, so make sure you register only when you have enough time available to take the challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 1: Build a sample front-end application\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step to accomplish this challenge is to create a sample front-end application. For this, we would like you to use Grommet. Keep it simple. All we really need is a sample app with a web interface. If you need help, the Grommet Workshop is your best point of reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quiz question 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the URL of the Grommet Designer?"

    "# Step 2: Run your web application locally\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step will be to make your sample application run locally on your machine. This is described in great detail in [Lab 3 of the Grommet Workshop](../WKSHP-Grommet/3-WKSHP-PrepareEnvironment.ipynb), so please refer back and make use of the session’s notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 3: Containerize your application\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, you will make your application run locally in a container. This is the trickiest piece as it's not described in any workshop, but we will guide you through it. This step requires that you have Docker installed on your machine. (If you need Docker follow [these instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to download it onto your work environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: Start a Terminal session to run your docker commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once Docker runs, you can use the following `Dockerfile` (also provided in the repo) to package your application in a container.\n",
    "\n",
    "````\n",
    "FROM node\n",
    " \n",
    "RUN mkdir /app\n",
    "# set working directory\n",

    " \n",
    "# add `/app/node_modules/.bin` to $PATH\n",
    "ENV PATH /app/node_modules/.bin:$PATH\n",
    " \n",
    "# install and cache app dependencies\n",
    "COPY package.json /app/package.json\n",

    "# start app\n",
    "CMD [\"npm\", \"start\"]\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this `Dockerfile`, create a container image for your application. Once the image is created, test your application by launching a container from that image and connecting to the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 4: Upload container in DockerHub\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have built your container using the provided Dockerfile (and docker build) and tested it, you will need to tag your image (with docker tag) to prepare it for uploading  on to your DockerHub account (If you do not have a DockerHub account yet, create one [here](https://hub.docker.com/)). Once you are logged into your DockerHub account, create an empty repository for your container image. Then, upload your container image to your repository (using docker push).\n",
    "\n",
    "Check [this article](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/push/) for more details about docker push if you need additional help.\n",

    "# Step 5: Make your application run in a Kubernetes environment\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the final step of the challenge. We will ask you to use the containerized version of your application in a Kubernetes environment managed by HPE Container Platform. To do this, you will create a resource file (in YAML) that will create the necessary Kubernetes artifacts to run the Docker image of your application in our K8S cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow these instructions from the [Hack Shack W479: Introduction to the HPE Container Platform REST API](../WKSHP-HPECP-API/2-WKSHP-HPECP-DeployApp-K8S-Tenant-tf.ipynb) notebook to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Login to HPE Container Platform\n",
    "2. Retrieve a valid kubeconfig file\n",
    "3. Define your KUBECONFIG environment variable\n",
    "4. Use kubectl to manage your containerized applications running on Kubernetes cluster managed by HPE Container Platform\n",
    "5. Create a my-app-\\<yourName>.yaml file that declares a **deployment** and a **service** for your application container image\n",
    "6. Deploy you app artifacts (a deployment and a service) using the kubectl apply –f my-app-\\<yourName>.yaml command\n",
    "7. Test connectivity to your app\n",
    "8. Delete your app deployment artifacts from Kubernetes cluster using kubectl delete –f my-app-\\<yourName>.yaml command\n",
    "9. Logout from HPE Container Platform\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: For these steps, you can continue to work in your Terminal session or you can run commands from code cells of the [Hack Shack W479: Introduction to the HPE Container Platform REST API](../WKSHP-HPECP-API/2-WKSHP-HPECP-DeployApp-K8S-Tenant-tf.ipynb) notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a couple of hints. \n",
    "\n",
    "First try to get your application to run in the K8S Cluster using `kubectl run -i -t` and then use `kubectl get pod -o yaml` to extract the corresponding YAML file. Make sure you use unique names for artifacts so it doesn't conflict with other challengers (for example, by appending your name). \n",
    "\n",
    "We also recommend to have your NodePort service port name prefixed with “http-“ so your service will get SSL termination at the gateway host.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: The first time an application is deployed, it may take some minutes to reach its \"running\" state, as the relevant Docker image must be downloaded and imported into the Kubernetes worker host.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note:  You can ignore the message \"If you don't see a command prompt, try pressing enter. Error attaching, falling back to logs: pods \"your pod name\" is forbidden. User cannot create resource \"pods/attach\" in API group in the namespace \"k8shacktenant\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you run the kubectl run command from a Terminal session, Press Control-C to go to the command prompt.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "**If you run the kubectl from the Jupyter Notebook, stop execution of the cell code by using \"Interrupt the Kernel\" button at the top of your Notebook.**\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: The first time an application type is created in the Kubernetes cluster, it may take some minutes to reach its \"running\" state, as the relevant Docker image must be downloaded and imported in a Kubernetes worker host.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your application runs in a K8s POD and your app NodePort Service is running, from the NodePort service description, obtain the following information:\n",
    " \n",
    "- The gateway host FQDN (this should be hpecpgw1.hp.local on our HPE Container Platform deployment)\n",
    "- The re-mapped gateway port (a port greater than 10000)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: You can follow the instructions from the [Hack Shack W479: Introduction to the HPE Container Platform REST API](../WKSHP-HPECP-API/2-WKSHP-HPECP-DeployApp-K8S-Tenant-tf.ipynb) workshop to find out the HPE CP gateway host and re-mapped port number of your running application.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then verify your app is responding and connect to it:\n",
    "    \n",
    "- From the challenge Jupyter Notebook, call your App using cURL command to make an HTTPS request as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "    `curl -k -i [-s][-L] https://<gateway-host>:<remapped-port>`  \n",
    "\n",
    "- From your browser, open a new tab and connect to your application over the Internet at: \n",
